# Community House Calendar

In the community where I live, there is a community house which everyone can use.
To reserve the community house one needs to make an entry into our community house calendar.
So far, this Calendar was created by hand on a computer, which was very tedious and error prone, and then printed.

In this small project I automated the generation of the community calendar with the tools I am used to work with.
The end result can be accessed here: https://janlucaklees.github.io/haus-1-kalender/

For optimal print results, use Chrome. Edge also looks fine. Stay away from FireFox,
Safari is untested due to the lack of Macs in my household.

## Usage
1. open https://janlucaklees.github.io/haus-1-kalender/.
2. select the year you want to have the calendar generated for.
3. print.
